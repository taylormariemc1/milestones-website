      <h2>Helpful Technologies</h2>
      <p>In 1978, the first computer was officially installed in the White House. The government had paid for many computing projects all the way back until the 1940’s, but a computer was not actually installed until the Carter administration. The Laser-Disc also was introduced this year, by MCA and Philips. The first one sold here in North America was the movie Jaws. While it did offer better audio and video quality than its competitors, it was a lot more expensive than any of its competitors. Around this time, Texas Instruments introduced a talking and learning aid for children 7 and older called the Speak and Spell. It used linear coding to formulate a model of the human voice and predict a speech depending on input that was put in previously It transformed through information that was processed through a filter and that had the ability to store more than 100 sounds. </p>

      <h2>Different Systems</h2>
      <p>Acorn's ARM RISC microprocessor was the first used in this company's Archimedes computer system. IN 1987, Acorn spun off of ARM like it was its own company. It was being used to design but turned in to mobile computing. During this time, the Conner CP340A hard disk drive was introduced. It was controlled by a microprocessor and was using embedded servo positioning and had self-testing functionality. It sold like crazy and very, very quickly it gained a huge market, due to an agreement with Compaq to use the product in their computers. Because of that, it quickly became one of the fastest growing companies in the U.S. Another invention in 1987 was the Mitsubishi Move-master RM-501 Gripper. It was an industrial robot that was used for tasks like assembling products and handling chemicals. It had 6 degrees of freedom and was controlled by electric motors, but can only reach 15 inches and can only pick up around 3 pounds or less. </p>

  <h2>New Desktops</h2>
  <p>This year was the first year that a VAIO was introduced. A VAIO is a desktop computer that features an extra 3D interface as well as the operating system. The VAIO was known as the best laptops that designed an audio-video capability and had communities, but the line was discontinued in 2014. In 1996, Donna Dubinsky, Jeff Hawkins, and Ed Colligan created software for a personal data assistant. It was known as Palm Inc. The first Palm productions ever made were the Palm 1000 and the Palm 5000, and they were based around a microprocessor that uses special gestural input language that was very easy to use called Graffiti. Palm is very easily connected to a PC or Mac using a port to combine the two. Towards the end of 1996, they had 36 million web users on palm that passed the 30 million until the most popular system recently. </p>

  <h2>New Social Media and Meanings</h2>
  <p>In 2003, the first Blu-ray optical disc was released. It was high definition and was supposed to be the successor to the DVD. The disc got its name from a pretty short wavelength blue laser that read data on each disc and it was capable of reading stored data at a higher density compared to a red laser. There was a small storage format battle between Blu-ray and HD DVD, that was being supported by Toshiba and in the end Blu-ray ultimately prevailed. In 2203, My-Space was not necessarily the largest or the smallest social media network but it was one of the most important and was a huge help to the second wave of social networking. Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson developed My-Space based on the features of a network called Friendster and they just added more features. By 2005, My-Space was a huge social media networking site and had more than 100 million users. It had very increased competition with Facebook rising and that was what led My-Space to eventually just fading out.

<h2>Technology Take Over</h2>
<p>Several people attempted to make computers into watches, and it wasn’t done until 2015 with the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch was made specifically for being compatible with an iPhone and a Mac Book. There were just about 1 million Apple watches sold on the day of the release. Everybody loved them and wanted one, and the only negative things that were ever said was that there was a limited battery life and that they were really expensive. Another important event that happened in 2015, was that Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, joined a number of tech gurus and scientists in voicing his thoughts on the dangers and unintended consequences of fake intelligence. Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and others had some of the same worries. They felt as if short term intelligence machines would help people, but as far as machines that do everything for people could potentially pose a grave threat. </p>
